This is a Systems administration tool which helps track batch processing tasks.  Originally written in Python and using XML-RPC, a service receives simple XML-RPC packets via HTTP POST requests.  With those XML-RPC packets, methods are executed which create events on a google calendar.  As such, visual tracking of when thing start, and when things finish, may be done. \r\n","name":"Randy Wallace","tagline":""}
